# Yechuandanmu-client

A Python + Pythonista implementation to post / autospawn live Danmaku onto Ethanluoyc's danmaku system. We used it with <3 for 叶串2015!

It allows both manual posting and automatic thread pool to post messages onte the Danmaku server. You can adjust the post interval as well as customizing a template danmaku pool for sequential/random spawning.

Without my last-minute help, this project may not be possible. :D

The app runs on Python in single-thread mode, as well as Pythonista (an iOS implementation) in multuthread, complete with native GUI support in iOS. However, you need Pythonista in place to run my code:)
